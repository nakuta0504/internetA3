        '''This function is called whenever a data packet is
        received. `seq_range` is the range of sequence numbers
        received: It contains two numbers: the starting sequence
        number (inclusive) and ending sequence number (exclusive) of
        the data received. `data` is a binary string of length
        `seq_range[1] - seq_range[0]` representing the data.

        It should output the list of sequence number ranges to
        acknowledge and any data that is ready to be sent to the
        application. Note, data must be sent to the application
        _reliably_ and _in order_ of the sequence numbers. This means
        that if bytes in sequence numbers 0-10000 and 11000-15000 have
        been received, only 0-10000 must be sent to the application,
        since if we send the latter bytes, we will not be able to send
        bytes 10000-11000 in order when they arrive. The transport
        layer must hide hide all packet reordering and loss.

        The ultimate behavior of the program should be that the data
        sent by the sender should be stored exactly in the same order
        at the receiver in a file in the same directory. No gaps, no
        reordering. You may assume that our test cases only ever send
        printable ASCII characters (letters, numbers, punctuation,
        newline etc), so that terminal output can be used to debug the
        program.

        point. If not, there is a bug in the code. A real transport
        stack will deallocate the receive buffer. Note, this may not
        be called if the fin packet from the sender is locked. You can
        read up on "TCP connection termination" to know more about how

def start_receiver(ip: str, port: int):
    '''Starts a receiver thread. For each source address, we start a new
    `Receiver` class. When a `fin` packet is received, we call the
    `finish` function of that class.

    We start listening on the given IP address and port. By setting
    the IP address to be `0.0.0.0`, you can make it listen on all
    available interfaces. A network interface is typically a device
    connected to a computer that interfaces with the physical world to
    send/receive packets. The WiFi and ethernet cards on personal
    computers are examples of physical interfaces.

    Sometimes, when you start listening on a port and the program
    terminates incorrectly, it might not release the port
    immediately. It might take some time for the port to become
    available again, and you might get an error message saying that it
    could not bind to the desired port. In this case, just pick a
    different port. The old port will become available soon. Also,
    picking a port number below 1024 usually requires special
    permission from the OS. Pick a larger number. Numbers in the
    8000-9000 range are conventional.

    Virtual interfaces also exist. The most common one is `localhost',
    which has the default IP address of `127.0.0.1` (a universal
    constant across most machines). The Mahimahi network emulator also
    creates virtual interfaces that behave like real interfaces, but
    really only emulate a network link in software that shuttles
    packets between different virtual interfaces.
